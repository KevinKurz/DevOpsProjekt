# Userstory 3

As a Developer I want to display the Data we receive from the Devices. I only can display data which is stored in a storage.

## Task 1: Extend the IoTResource Template so it sends the Data to a Storage Account

## Task 2: Find a Way to test this route. Send Message and see the Result in Storage Account

## Task 3: Automate the test to validate the function for the future

## Task 4: Document the usage of your script so everybody can use it
