# UserStory2

As an Admin, I want to connect devices to the application. The Devices are sending MQTT Messages, which are needed in the Application.
We need an Endpoint in Azure, which receives all the IoT messages.

## Explenations

MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. MQTT works on the publisher / subscriber principle and is operated via a central broker. This means that the sender and receiver have no direct connection.

## Task 1: Find a Resource to receive IoT messages

Azure IoT Hub.

## Task 2: Create a Resource Template for it

## Task 3: Create Parameter Files for dev, test and prod resources

## Task 4: Extend the Deployment Script for this resource
