# Userstory 1

As a User I want to be able to access the application on all my devices without the need of an installation.
Therefore, I would use my browser and we need to create a resource to host a website.

## Task 1: Find a Resource to host a website on it

In Visual Studio Code you need to install the extension "Azure Storage". This extension integrates Azure Storage management functionality. The extension is able to deploy a static website to Azure Storage.
Storage typewise you go with an Azure Blob Storage.

## Task 2: Create a Resource Template for it

## Task 3: Create Parameter Files for dev, test and prod resources

## Task 4: Write a PowerShell Script to deploy all stages. You want to only deploy one stage per execution (./createWebApp.ps1 -Environment dev)

## Task 5: short documentation why you choose the resource and what other options you found. Compare the different Features
